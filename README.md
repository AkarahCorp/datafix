# Datafix
`datafix` is a Rust library designed to deserialize & serialize data, and upgrade data between versions.
This crate is a Rust reimplementation of Mojang's [DataFixerUpper](https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper/) library.
APIs may differ in some parts due to differences between Java and Rust.
